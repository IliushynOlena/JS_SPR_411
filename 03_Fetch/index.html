    <h1>HTTP Request & Responce using Fetch()</h1>
    <p>The fetch() method in JavaScript is used to initiate a network request to
         retrieve a resource (like data from an API) from a server. It's a modern 
         replacement for XMLHttpRequest and is part of the Fetch API. fetch() returns 
         a Promise that resolves to a Response object, allowing you to handle the response
          (success or error) asynchronously. </p>
